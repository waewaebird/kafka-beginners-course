## Question 7
___
StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
KStream textLines = builder.stream("word-count-input");
KTable wordCounts = textLines
.mapValues(textLine -> textLine.toLowerCase())
.flatMapValues(textLine -> Arrays.asList(textLine.split("\W+")))
.selectKey((key, word) -> word)
.groupByKey()
.count(Materialized.as("Counts"));
wordCounts.toStream().to("word-count-output", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()));
builder.build();
- [ ] A. max.message.bytes=10000000
- [ ] B. cleanup.policy=delete
- [ ] C. compression.type=lz4
- [ ] D. cleanup.policy=compact

<details>
<summary>
